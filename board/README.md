## Responsibilities of the Board of Directors

The National Council of Nonprofits summarizes the role of a nonprofit's board directors[^1] as:

> Board members are the fiduciaries who steer the organization towards a sustainable future by adopting sound, ethical, and legal governance and financial management policies, as well as by making sure the nonprofit has adequate resources to advance its mission.

### Legal Responsibilites
The legal duties of nonprofit boards are summarized as the duties of care, loyalty, and obedience. Here is a summary,[^2] again from 
The National Council of Nonprofits:

[^2]: National Council of Nonprofits "[Board Roles and Responsibilities](https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/tools-resources/board-roles-and-responsibilities)"

1. Duty of Care: Take care of the nonprofit by ensuring prudent use of all assets, including facility, people, and good will;
1. Duty of Loyalty: Ensure that the nonprofit's activities and transactions are, first and foremost, advancing its mission; Recognize and disclose conflicts of interest; Make decisions that are in the best interest of the nonprofit corporation; not in the best interest of the individual board member (or any other individual or for-profit entity).
1. Duty of Obedience: Ensure that the nonprofit obeys applicable laws and regulations; follows its own bylaws; and that the nonprofit adheres to its stated corporate purposes/mission.

### Strategic and Management Responsibilities

In addition to its legal responsibilties, the board stewards the organzation for long-term sustainability in service of its mission.
Because NYPH is a nonprofit with no full-time staff, the role of the board of directors is doubly important to ensure a vibrant and sustainable organization.

The NYPH board holds the following additional responsibilties:
- Ensure that the day-to-day work of NYPH is well-run.
- Ensure that NYPH is open and transparent to its members and stakeholders
- Ensure that NYPH is well-positioned to exert long-term leadership in New York City and New York State in its chosen mission

[30%] of Board members shall be nominated by the Nominating Committee of the Board of
Directors and the balance of such Directors shall be elected annually for two year terms by a

Prospective directors may self-nominate or be nominated by a current director.
