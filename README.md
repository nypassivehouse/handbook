# Welcome to the New York Passive House (NYPH) Handbook

Hello! This handbook is an effort to create a durable institutional memory for NYPH
and a tool for on-going open collaboration among NYPH members.

[NYPH was founded in 2010](https://www.nypassivehouse.org/about-new-york-passive-house/)
as a membership organization by buildings-sector professionals.

As the organizaiton has grown over the years, there has been less integration and exchange
between members and the board of directors.
Recognizing the surge in interest in climate action across economic sectors as an important opportunity for NYPH
and also noting that there are now many competing visions in how to achieve carbon goals,
NYPH now seeks to enhance its effectiveness by investing in member engagement.
This handbook, along with the [NYPH Slack](https://newyorkpassivehouse.slack.com/), is a part of this effort.

## What is this?

The NYPH handbook is an open living document under [version-control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control).
Open means that it is open to viewing by anyone 
and also open to suggestions and edits by the NYPH community (NYPH members and stakeholders).
Living document means that it includes both static documentation of the past (minutes)
and of information that will change over time.
Version control enables [collaborative editing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_editing).

or if it would infringe on the privacy of individuals.
